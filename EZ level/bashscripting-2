Q61: Write a script that will ask username and password from user and then using if condition verify if username="admin" and password="admin" , if condition meets then print "Login Success" else print "Wrong Login" ?

#!/bin/bash
read -p "username" usern
read -p "password" passw
if [[($usern=="admin" && $passw=="admin")]]
then echo "Login success"
else echo "Wrong Login"
fi

or

#!/bin/bash
echo "enter username"
read usern
echo "enter password"
read passw
if [[($usern=="admin"&& $passw=="admin")]]
then echo "Login success"
else echo "wrong Login"
fi

Notes : Read command is used to input things fromusers or read inputs and read-p is used for prompting user with reading the input given by them

Q62: Write a script that will ask a number from user and then using if condition verify if number is divisible by 3 and 5 both , if condition meets then print "Divisible" else print "Not Divisible" ?

#!/bin/bash
Write a script that will ask a number from user and then using if condition verify if number is divisible by 3 and 5 both , if condition meets then print "Divisible" else print "Not Divisible" ?

#!/bin/bash
echo "give an number"
read num
if [[(($num%3))==0 $$ (($num%5))==0 ]]
then echo "divisible"
else echo "not divisible"
fi

notes: major cconfusion with syntax

Q63: Write a script that will ask a number from user and then using if condition verify if number is divisible by 3 or 5 (any one) , if condition meets then print "Divisible" else print "Not Divisible" ?

#!/bin/bash
echo "give me an number"
read num
if (($num%3 ==0 || $num%5 == 0))
then  echo "Divisible"
else echo "Not divisble"
fi

Notes: Just use double brackets for any kind of arithmetic operation cleaner 

Q64: Write a script that will ask a number from user and then using if condition verify if number is divisible by 3 or 5 or 7 (any one) , if condition meets then print "Divisible" else print "Not Divisible" ?

#!/bin/bash
read -p "give me an number" numero
if (($numero%3 == 0 || $numero%5 == 0 || $numero%7 ==0))
then echo "Divisible"
else echo "Not Divisible"
fi

Q65: Write a script that will print numbers 1 to 20 on screen using for loop ?

#!/bin/bash
for i in {0..20}
do
echo "$i"
done

Notes: For , do and done are the syntax we can use for for loops 
{} for defining a set of numbers

Q66: Write a script that will create a directory with name "dummy" and then generate 10 empty files named like 1, 2 ... 10 in that dummy directory using for loop ?

#!/bin/bash
mkdir dummy
for i in {1..10}
do
touch ./dummy/$i
done 


Q67: Write a script that will iterate between 1 to 100 and print all numbers divisible by 5 ?

#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..100}
do 
if $((i%5 == 0))  
then echo $i
fi
done 

Q68: Write a script that will print numbers 1 to 10 on screen using while loop ?

#!/bin/bash
i = 0
while [$i -le 10]
do 
echo $i
((i++))
done

Notes : since -le (less than) is a non arithmetic function we are using square backs 

We can also do this 

#!/bin/bash
i = 0
while ((i <= 10))
do echo $i
((i++))
done 

Notes : using arithmetic operation so using double simple brackets
and i ++ is when we add 1 to the exisitng value 
 
Q69: Write a script that will keep running (using while loop) with "sleep 1" command until user press ctrl+c to kill it ?

#!/bin/bash
i == 0
while i >= 0 
do echo "press ctrl or command + c to end"
((i++))
sleep 1
done

or 

#!/bin/bash
while :
do
echo "press CTRL+C or CMD+C to stop"
sleep 1 
done

Notes: here While : always gives out success and never fails 
but always prints the echo message 


Q70: Write a script that will keep printing numbers from 1 to 10, if the number in loop is 2 then loop must break and shall not continue to print ?
using for loop :

#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..10}
do echo $i
((i++))
if (($i == 2))
then 
break
fi 
done

using while loop:

#!/bin/bash
i=0
while ((i <= 10))
do 
 echo $i
 ((i++))
  if (($i == 2 ))
  then 
   break
  fi 
done


Q71: Write a script that will keep printing numbers from 1 to 5, and skip if number is 3 (Use while loop and Continue statement) ?

#!/bin/bash
i=0
while (($i <= 4))
do 
 ((i++))
 if (($i == 3))
 then
 continue
 fi
 echo "$i"
done   

Notes:logic is when variable equals 0 and while variable is less than 4 , make sure variable is added with a +1 and if variable now is equals to 3 , then set continue statement else , go on wth the next number 
OP will be 1, 2, 4, 5 for 4 if we set 5 it will be 1,2,4,5,6

Q72: A.Write a script that will keep printing odd numbers between 1 to 100 ?

#!/bin/bash
i=0
while ((i <= 100))
do 
 ((i++))
 if ((i%2 != 0))
 echo "$i"
 fi
done

Notes: noted if in the arithmetic modulus no need of $ to call in the varibale 

Another way to find the odd numbers are (most elegant way)

#!/bin/bash
for ((i=1; i<=100; i=i+2))
do
echo "$i"
done 

Notes: The (())- arithmetic modulus contains the init , conditiion for the loop and the progression increment
another while method:
#!/bin/bash
i=1
while ((i<=100))
do echo "$i"
   ((i=i+2))
done
   
Q73: B.Write a script that will keep printing even numbers between 1 to 100 ?

#!/bin/bash
for ((i=2; i<=100; i=i+2))
do
echo "$i"
done

notes in the arithmetic modulus (init , Condition , progression is set straight )
The loop will follow the loop first with do so starting with 2 , if we start with zero , 0 will also be printed

Q74: Write a script that will ask 2 numbers from user and then prints the sum of given 2 numbers ?

#!/bin/bash
read -p "give me no:1" num1
read -p "give me no:2" num2
sum=$((num1+num2))
echo "$sum"

Another way:

#!/bin/bash
echo "number 1"
read num1
echo "number 2"
read num2
sleep 2
echo "The sum is $((num1+num2))"

notes: sleep 2 is for drama 


Q75: Write a script that will ask 2 numbers from user and then prints the multiplication of given 2 numbers ?

#!/bin/bash
echo "give no1"
read
echo "give no2"
read
echo "The multiplied values is $((num1*num2))"

Notes: Just like + for addition * is used for multiplication in bash
